# Better Screens

Better screens is a simple mod that adds two features, "Prevent Closing Screens" and "Don't Reset Cursor".

## Features

**Prevent Closing Screens**: Prevents the server from forcefully closing your screens. For example, your chat screen when a Hypixel SkyWars game starts.

**Don't Reset Cursor**: Keeps your cursor in the same spot when opening a new screen immediately after the last. For example, backpack slots in Hypixel SkyBlock.

These features were created by Moulberry for [MoulberrysTweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/moulberrystweaks) and nea89o for [Firmament](https://modrinth.com/mod/firmament) respectively.

## Reasons For Making This Mod

Neither MoulberrysTweaks nor Firmament are updated to the latest version of Minecraft at the time of writing, 1.21.8. Additionally, both include features that I do not want, especially Firmament, which is a massive SkyBlock mod, while I wanted something more lightweight.

If you play SkyBlock or have any uses for the other features in MoulberrysTweaks, I recommend you to use their mods instead.
